## Context sensitive pie menu
Meant to work in conjunction with Blender's official pie-menu add-on. Brings pie menus to poly modeling, curve editing, uv mapping and animation. Replaces the traditional context sensitive menu with a pie menu, enabling many more functions on the same hotkey. Pie menus lets muscle memory remember where operations are much faster than reading through a long listed menu will. Operations are sensibly placed across contexts. The top option in Edit Mesh will "Merge". In Object mode it will "Join" and in Edit Curve it will "Make Segment" between selected points.

## Shortcuts
**Right Mouse** :                    Mode selection pie menu

**Shift + Right Mouse**:        Context sensitive pie menu

Made with inspiration from an ancient Mayan pie recipe and works well with the industry compatible keymap.

RELEASE NOTES:
First test version using the extensions website.

Context menu functions in these contexts:
 * Object Mode
 * Edit Mesh
 * Edit Curve 
 * UV Editor
 * Pose Mode
 * Edit Armature
 * Sculpt Mode.
