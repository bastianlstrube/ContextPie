## Context sensitive pie menu
Meant to work in conjunction with Blender's official pie-menu add-on.
Brings pie menus to poly modeling, curve editing, uv mapping and animation.
Replaces the traditional context sensitive menu with a pie menu, enabling many more functions on the same hotkey. Pie menus also lets muscle memory navigate the menus much faster than reading through a long list will. 

## Shortcuts
**Right Mouse** :                    Mode selection pie menu

**Shift + Right Mouse**:        Context sensitive pie menu

Made following an ancient Mayan pie recipe and works well with the industry compatible keymap.

RELEASE NOTES:
First test version using the extensions website.

Context menu functions in these contexts:
 * Object Mode
 * Edit Mesh
 * Edit Curve 
 * UV Editor
 * Pose Mode
 * Edit Armature
 * Sculpt Mode.
