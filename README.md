# Context Sensitive Pie Menu
3 hotkeys to access most functionality as fast as possible. Brings pie menus to poly modeling, curve editing, uv mapping and animation. Replaces the traditional context menu with a pie menu, enabling many more functions on the same hotkey. Pie menus gets faster to navigate with muscle memory and lets you focus on the task at hand. Operations are sensibly placed across contexts. The top option will "Merge" in Edit mode, "Join" in Object mode and "Make Segment" between selected points in Edit Curve mode.
