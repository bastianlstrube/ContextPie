# Context Sensitive Pie Menu
Meant to work in conjunction with Blender's official pie-menu add-on.
Brings pie menus to poly modeling, curve editing, uv mapping and animation.
Replaces the traditional context sensitive menu with a pie menu, enabling many more functions on the same hotkey. Pie menus also lets muscle memory navigate the menus much faster than reading through a long list will. 

## Shortcuts
**Right Mouse** :                    Mode selection pie menu

**Shift + Right Mouse**:        Context sensitive pie menu

**Ctrl + Right Mouse**:         Pivots pie menu

Made following an ancient Mayan pie recipe and works well with the industry compatible keymap.


## Installation:

Install from [extensions.blender.org](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/contextpie/) or directly from Blender in Preferences Menu > Extensions, search for 'Context Pie'.
